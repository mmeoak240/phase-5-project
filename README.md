Welcome to AllStudy, your ultimate study buddy! With AllStudy you can create notebooks for your various courses and take notes within these notebooks(obviously). You will be able to attach tabs to your notes for easy organization and hekp in finding the notes you need faster. Are you one of those people who loves to use flashcards to ingrain information into your head? Great! You can do that too by making flashcards that have a front and back with a flip function(also may be tabbed so you can study only what you need).

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide an all in one study tool for students whether they be in High School, college or even in a coding bootcamp.
I have always struggled with taking and organizing my notes. I would have notes on google docs, in a note book, paper flashcards and bookmarked browser pages. This approach might work for some people but not everyone. I wanted to create a place to keep everything; notebooks, flashcards, scheduleing and more, all the tools a student needs to succeed.

## Features

- Creation of notebooks and notes within those notebooks.
- Ability to edit notes.
- Creation of flippable flashcards
- All notes and flashcards can be tabbed to organize and study only what you need.

## Comming Features

Features that will be added with future updates will be:

- Access to a dictionary and thesaurus to make sure you understand everything your reading while studying.
- Access to google calenders to keep track of classes and deadlines.
- A links page to save an organize websites you may be using.
- The ability for students to share notes.

## Install

This application was created using Ruby 2.7.4 and Rails 6.1.3.
To check your versions type the following into you console

<!-- This project is scaffolded so that you can build a React frontend and Rails
backend together, and easily deploy them to Render.

**Note**: if you are not planning to deploy your app to Render and prefer to use
SQLite, you will need to make the following changes in the project files:

1. In the `Gemfile`, replace `gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'` with `gem 'sqlite3', '~>
   1.4'`.
2. In the `database.yml` file, change the line `adapter: postgresql` to
   `adapter: sqlite3`.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Render account
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

## Setup

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the project template repository and removing
