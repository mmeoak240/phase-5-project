<!-- This project is scaffolded so that you can build a React frontend and Rails
backend together, and easily deploy them to Render.

**Note**: if you are not planning to deploy your app to Render and prefer to use
SQLite, you will need to make the following changes in the project files:

1. In the `Gemfile`, replace `gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'` with `gem 'sqlite3', '~>
   1.4'`.
2. In the `database.yml` file, change the line `adapter: postgresql` to
   `adapter: sqlite3`.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Render account
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

## Setup

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the project template repository and removing
the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
``` -->
